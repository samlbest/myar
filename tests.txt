Tests

I ran tests against ar's output for each of the options. Some tests are automated by the
Makefile target "tests", which executes the targets specified in the assignment, as well 
as some additional tests.

The main input files I used were the text files contained in Homework3SampleData.tar.bzip. 
Any other files I used for testing were text files I created or source/object files that 
happened to be in the same directory.

Extra Makefile tests (besides ones specified in assignment):
testd12345: creates two archives with all test files. Runs -d 1-s.txt 2-s.txt 3-s.txt 4-s.txt 5-s.txt
using myar on one archive and ar on the other then compares the two archives with diff.
testd135: same as testd12345, but runs -d 1-s.txt 3-s.txt 5-s.txt
testd24: same as above, but runs -d 2-s.txt 4-s.txt
testx12345: creates an archive containing all of the test inputs, makes a backup of the original
test files, then runs myar -x to extract all files. Compares the extracted files to the backups
using diff.
All tests considered passing if diff didn't produce an output.

Manual tests:
-Tested all options with invalid inputs to make sure error messages were consistent with ar
-Tested -A with various types of files, using debug messages to make sure it only added regular
files.
-Tested -x to make sure it extracted the files with the correct permissions and timestamps
and with no modifications compared to the original files.
